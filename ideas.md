# Ideas for Discord RLCS Bot

## Language
---
* Python -> Fun to use, currently knowledgeable
* C# -> Better than java imo, but not very good at it. Useful in make personal projects to benefit my skills at work.
* Java -> no

## API
---
https://zsr.octane.gg


## Features
---
* With Discord commands, control the bot and request information
  * get player stats
  * game/match stats
  * league/split stats
  * list upcoming matches
  * list standings maybe
  * top scorers maybe?? that could be cool idk

* Advanced Ideas
  * Generate visualizations from commands
  * cache data to prevent too many api calls
  * OctaneGG .NET API wrapper

## Beta
---
I want to actually work on and complete this project so each 
feature must go through some form of *beta* stage. I need to test
everything completely to my highest standards (realistically) so
that my bot isn't broken all the time. 

Once tested I can move onto another feature.
